SAT problems taken from

  http://github.com/dbueno/funsat

We chose ones that parsed quickly but ran for longer times. The "good"
benchmark possibilities we found were:

  bench/parity/par16-5.cnf
  bench/parity/par16-5-c.cnf
  bench/parity/par16-4.cnf
  bench/parity/par16-4-c.cnf
  bench/parity/par16-3.cnf
  bench/parity/par16-2.cnf
  bench/parity/par16-2-c.cnf
  bench/parity/par16-1.cnf
  bench/parity/par16-1-c.cnf
  bench/phole/hole8.cnf
